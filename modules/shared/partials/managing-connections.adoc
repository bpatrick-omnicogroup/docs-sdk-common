== Working in the Cloud

For most use cases, connecting client software using a Couchbase SDK to the new https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clouds/clouds.html[Couchbase Cloud service] is similar to connecting to an on-premises Couchbase Cluster.
The use of DNS-SRV. Altermate Address, and TLS is covered above.

We strongly recommend that the client and server xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#network-requirements[are in the same LAN-like environment] (e.g. AWS Availability Zone).
As this may not always be possible during development, read the guidance on working with xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#commonly-used-options[constrained network environments].
More details on connecting your client code to the Couchbase Cloud can be found https://docs.stage.nonprod-project-avengers.com/cloud/BETA/get-started/connect-to-cluster.html#locate-the-clusters-endpoints-and-built-in-sdk-examples[in the Cloud docs].
