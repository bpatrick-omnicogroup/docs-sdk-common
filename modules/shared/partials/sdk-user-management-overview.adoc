= User Management

[abstract]
The SDK now lets you create _users_, assign them _roles_ and associated _privileges_, and remove them from the system.

[#users_resources_roles_and_privileges]

== Users, Resources, Roles, and Privileges

Couchbase Server 5.0 Enterprise Edition introduces _Role-Based Access Control_ for applications.
This means that _resources_ on a Couchbase cluster can only be accessed by an identified _user_.

Each user who attempts resource-access is identified by means of the _credentials_ they pass to Couchbase Server, for purposes of _authentication_: these consist of a _username_ and (typically) a _password_.
Once the user is authenticated, an _authorization_ process checks the _roles_ with which the user is associated.
If one or more of these roles correspond to _privileges_ that permit the user-requested level of resource-access, access is duly granted; otherwise, it is denied.

Users who have been assigned the *Admin* role for the cluster are able to create, edit, and remove users.
The SDK provides APIs to support these activities.

[#creating_a_user]
// tag::creating_a_user[]
== Creating a User

The syntax required for creating a user varies according to language.
The basic form is as follows:

----
boolean upsertUser (String userid, UserSettings settings)
----

The method *upsertUser* creates a user and adds the user to the Couchbase Cluster.
The user will subsequently be visible in the *Security* panel of the Couchbase Web Console.
Note that successful user-addition results in a user _locally_ defined, with _username_ and _password_ stored on Couchbase Server: _external_ users (whose credentials reside on a network-available server, possibly accessed by means of LDAP) should not be created by this SDK method.
If the local user created by *upsertUser* already exists, the previous definition is overwritten.

The method takes two arguments.
The first, a _String_ is the user ID of the user to be created: for example, `johnsmith0325`, or `user734`.
This must be specified.

The second is a _UserSettings_ object.
This takes the following form:

----
UserSettings {
    String password;
    String name;
    Role[] roles;
}
----

The object contains three data-members.
The first is a _String_ that specifies the user's password: this must be provided.
The second is a _String_ that specifies the user's name (for example, `John Smith`): this is optional, and so may be omitted.
The third is an array of _Role_ objects: this must be specified.
Each _Role_ object takes the following form:

----
Role {
    String role;
    String bucket_name;
}
----

The object's two data-members are both _Strings_, and must both be specified.
The _String_ specified as the role must correspond to a role supported by Couchbase Server.
The _String_ specified as the bucket_name must either correspond to a bucket currently defined on Couchbase Server; or be the asterisk character (_*_), meaning _all buckets_.

The method returns a _boolean_, which is `true` if the operation is successful, otherwise `false`.
// end::creating_a_user[]

[#listing_users]
// tag::listing_users[]
== Listing Users

The basic form of the method used to return currently defined users is as follows:

----
List<User> getUsers()
----

The method returns a list of _User_ objects, each of which takes the following form:

----
User {
    String name;
    String id;
    String domain;
    Role[] roles;
}
----

The name is the full name of the user.
The id is the user's ID.
The domain is either `local` or `external`.
Each Role object in the Role-array has the form already described above, in _Creating a User_.
// end::listing_users[]

[#getting_a_user]
// tag::getting_a_user[]
== Getting a User

The basic form of the method used to return an already defined user is as follows:

----
User getUser (String userid)
----

The method returns a _User_ object, which takes the following form:

----
User {
    String name;
    String id;
    String domain;
    Role[] roles;
}
----

The name is the full name of the user.
The id is the user's ID.
The domain is either `local` or `external`.
Each Role object in the Role-array has the form described above, in _Creating a User_.
// end::getting_a_user[]

[#removing_a_user]
// tag::removing_a_user[]
== Removing a User

The basic form of the method used to remove users is as follows:

----
boolean removeUser (String userid)
----

The method's sole argument is the id of the user to be removed from the system, specified as a _String_.
The method returns a _boolean_, whose value is `true` if the operation is successful, otherwise `false`.
// end::removing_a_user[]
