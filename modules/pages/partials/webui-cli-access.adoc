= Browser and CLI Access
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
You can browse and access documents in Couchbase using browser and command line tools without writing any code.
This can be helpful to you if you simply wish to inspect cluster data without writing code.
You can access individual documents using the _command line_ and _web console_.

[#cli-access]
== Command-Line

You can access documents in Couchbase using command line interfaces.
You can use the `cbc` tool for simple document lookups by their IDs (or _keys_) and the xref:{version-server}@server:n1ql:n1ql-intro/cbq.adoc[cbq] tool to issue N1QL queries.
This section will discuss the installation and usage of the `cbc` tool, and is targeted towards Linux and Mac OS X users.

NOTE: You can also use `cbc` on Windows by extracting the archive with libcouchbase.
The archive contains `cbc.exe` by default.

== Installing the command-line KV client

To use the `cbc` tool, first install the C SDK.
Note that you will also need to install the _command line tools_.

.Debian/Ubuntu
[source,bash]
----
wget http://packages.couchbase.com.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/couchbase-release/couchbase-release-1.0-4-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i couchbase-release-1.0-4-amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcouchbase2-bin
----

.CentOS/RHEL
[source,bash]
----
wget http://packages.couchbase.com.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/couchbase-release/couchbase-release-1.0-4-x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -ivh couchbase-release-1.0-4-x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install libcouchbase2-bin
----

.Mac OS X
[source,bash]
----
brew install libcouchbase
----

NOTE: The `cbc` tool is part of the C SDK.
Refer to xref:2.10@c-sdk::start-using-sdk.adoc[C SDK] for other installation options.

== Using the command-line KV client

The `cbc` command contains subcommands that perform various operations on the server.
Some subcommands are:

* `cbc create` (create/update documents)
* `cbc cat` (retrieve a document)
* `cbc rm` (remove a document).

To point the client at a cluster, provide one of the cluster nodes using the -U argument:

 $ cbc cat document-id -U couchbase://node-ip-or-hostname

You can store a document using the `cbc create` command.

 $ cbc create document_id -V '{"json":"value"}'
 document_id         Stored. CAS=0xd0d92f40500

NOTE: The command line client is not JSON-aware.
If dealing with JSON documents, ensure that values passed to it are well formed JSON because the [.cmd]`cbc` program does not do any validation.

You can retrieve a document using the `cbc cat` subcommand.

 $ cbc cat document_id
 document_id          CAS=0xe0004ea40100, Flags=0x0. Size=16
 {"json":"value"}

You can find out more about the `cbc` command by referring to your local `man` pages or by viewing its https://github.com/couchbase/libcouchbase/blob/master/doc/cbc.markdown[documentation^].

== Using the command-line query shell (cbq)

You can use the xref:{version-server}@server:n1ql:n1ql-intro/cbq.adoc[cbq] program as a command line query shell to issue N1QL queries in couchbase.
_cbq_ is available on all cluster nodes and does not require a separate installation.
Simply run _cbq_ from the Couchbase installation directory (`/opt/couchbase/bin/cbq` on Linux and `"/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbq"`).
Once in the shell, you should be greeted by a prompt and ready to issue any N1QL query.

 $ ./cbq
 cbq> select airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE airportname IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1;
 {
     ...
     "results": [
         {
             "airportname": "Abbeville"
         }
     ]
     ...
 }

[#webui-access]
== Couchbase Web Console Document Access

You can use the Couchbase Web Console to view, edit, and create JSON documents up to 256KB in size.
To access documents using the Couchbase Web Console:

. Navigate your browser to a cluster node.
Type the address of the cluster with the admin port (8091).
Use your [.var]`username` (usually [.in]`Administrator`).
The [.var]`password` is the password you used when setting up the cluster.

. Once logged in, access the [.ui]*Buckets* view, by left-clicking on the [.ui]*Buckets* tab, in the navigation panel at the left-hand side.
The [.ui]*Buckets* view displays all buckets currently defined on your system.
In the illustration below, the `travel-sample` bucket is displayed:
+

. Left-click on the [.ui]*Documents* tab, at the right-hand side of the [.ui]*travel-sample* bucket-row.
This brings up the [.ui]*Documents* view, which lists the documents contained by the selected bucket:
+
image::{incimagesdir}/webui-documents.png[,820px]

. To retrieve a document, enter the document ID into the [.ui]*Look Up ID* field, at the upper-right; then left-click on the adjacent button.
The [.ui]*Documents Editing* page now appears.
This allows you to edit the selected document.

. To create a new document, return to the [.ui]*Documents* view, and click on [.ui]*Add Document*, at the upper right.
This brings up the [.ui]*Create Document* dialog, which allows you to enter a Document ID:
+
image::{incimagesdir}/webui-newdoc-prompt.png[,300px]

. Enter an appropriate ID, then save.
This bring up the [.ui]*Documents Editing* view.

== Couchbase Web Console Query Accesss

You can use the xref:{version-server}@server:tools:query-workbench.adoc[Query Workbench] to issue queries using the web console.
