= Travel App Data Model
:page-topic-type: reference

// tag::model[]
[abstract]
The data model for the travel app uses several distinct document types: airline, route, airport and landmark.


Our xref:hello-world:sample-application.adoc[tutorial introduction to using the SDK] uses the _Travel Sample_ data bucket.

== The Travel App data model

The data model for the travel app uses several distinct document types: airline, route, airport, and hotel.

The model for each kind of document contains:

* A key that acts as a primary key
* An `id` field that identifies the document
* A `type` field that identifies the kind of document

The following figure illustrates the relationship between the different kinds of documents in version 5.1 of the Travel App.
It shows the primary key, ID, and type fields that each document has, plus a few representative fields in each type of document.

Landmark documents are not used in the travel-sample application, which focuses on a more specific subset of point of interests that have their own type: hotels.

Hotels, like landmarks, don't have relations to other types.

== Airline documents

[.term]_Airline documents_ contain details about airlines such as the name of the airline, International Air Transport Association (IATA) two-character airline designator, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) three-character airline designator, and the airline call sign.

For airline documents, the value of the `type` field is `airline`.

.Airline document model
[source,json]
----
airline_24 			   ←This is the key, which also acts as a primary key
{
  "active": "Y",
  "callsign": "AMERICAN",
  "country": "United States",
  "iata": "AA",
  "icao": "AAL",
  "id": "24",
  "name": "American Airlines",
  "type": "airline"              ←This is the type identifier for the document
}
----

== Route documents

[.term]_Route documents_ contain details about flights such as the name of the airline, departure airport, destination airport, number of stops during the flight, type of aircraft, flight number, and flight schedule.

Route documents also contain a foreign key identifier, `airlineid`, that is used to retrieve the document that contains information about the airline that flies the route.
The value of the `airlineid` field is identical to the key for the corresponding airline document.

For route documents, the value of the `type` field is `route`.

.Route document model

route_5966                         ←This is the key, which also acts as a primary key

      {"day": 5, "utc": "13:25:00", "flight": "AA519"}
  ]
}
----

== Airport documents

[.term]_Airport documents_ contain details about airports  such as name, location, time zone, ICAO four-character alphanumeric airport code, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) location identifier.

For airport documents, the value of the `type` field is `airport`.

.Airport document model
[source,json]
----
airport_3577                       ←This is the key, which also acts as a primary key

      },
      "icao": "KSEA",
      "id": 3577,
      "type": "airport",         ←This is the type identifier for the document
      "tz": "America/Los_Angeles"
  }
}
----

== Hotel documents

[.term]_Hotel documents_ are all about a specific type of point of interests: hotels.
They include information such as a name, description, location (coutry, state, city and address), price and services, and even customer reviews.

For hotel documents, the value of the `type` field is `hotel`.

== N1QL query anatomy

The Couchbase Query API is a powerful tool for efficient retrieval of information from a document data store.
In each SDK-specific travel application, queries about flights are created by a dedicated module (for example in Node.js, the [.path]_flightPath.js_ module).
Here's an example of a query that finds flights between Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) and Orlando International Airport (MCO), followed by a description of what's happening in the query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT a.name, s.flight, s.utc, r.sourceairport, r.destinationairport, r.equipment
FROM `travel-sample` r
UNNEST r.schedule s
JOIN `travel-sample` a ON KEYS r.airlineid
WHERE r.sourceairport='SEA' AND r.destinationairport='MCO' AND s.day=6
ORDER BY a.name
----

N1QL provides JOIN functionality, something previously not possible in a document database.
For two documents to be joined in the result of a SELECT statement, one of them must contain a field whose value is equal to the Couchbase key of the other document.
The following example shows two documents that demonstrate that requirement and a SELECT statement that joins them:

----
"keyA" is the Couchbase KV key for Doc A.
Doc A: { some fields }

Doc B: { some fields "joinField": "keyA" }

SELECT * FROM default b JOIN default a ON KEYS b.joinField
----

The data model for the travel application includes an `airlineid` field in each `route` document.
That `airlineid` field is used as a foreign key identifier and corresponds to the key for an `airline` document.
To select the airline name `a.name`, the query uses the following clause: `pass:c[JOIN `travel-sample` a ON KEYS r.airlineid]`.

One of the powerful features available in the N1QL query language is the ability to `UNNEST` or flatten, the results returned in the `SELECT` statement.
This is frequently needed when working with JSON documents, which may have rich heirarchies.
In the data model for the travel application, each route document contains a nested collection of schedule documents.
To alleviate a complicated JSON parsing code pattern for the return results, you can have the query execution `UNNEST` the schedule documents, so they become the root-level fields in the returned results.

Standard SQL syntax is used in the `WHERE` clause for the `SELECT` statement.
The result set is ordered by the `a.name` field, which contains the airline name.

Refer to the xref:concept-docs:n1ql-query.adoc[Querying with N1QL] section for more information on using N1QL with the SDKs.


== Collections

In preparation for the introduction of xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[Collections] in an upcoming release of the Couchbase Data Platform, 
a version of the Travel Sample application is provided which contains a xref:howtos:working-with-collections.adoc#preparation[script] to split out user data into a separate collection.
To try this out with Couchbase Server 6.5 and 6.6, you will need to xref:6.5@server:developer-preview:collections/collections-overview.adoc[enable the Collections Developer Preview].
This _Developer Preview_ is not to be used in production.

The _Beta_ release of Couchbase Server 7.0 offers the chance to try out a xref:7.0@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#configuring-sample-buckets[Collections-ready Travel Sample Bucket].
