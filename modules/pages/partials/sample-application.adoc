Travel Sample Application uses the Travel Sample data Bucket, which ships with Couchbase Server.
For Couchbase Server 6.5, make sure that you have at least one node each of data; query; index; and search.
For a development box, mixing more than one of these on a single node (given enough memory resources) is perfectly acceptable.
If you have yet to install Couchbase Server in your development environment, xref:6.5@server:getting-started:do-a-quick-install.adoc[start here].

Then load up the Travel Sample Bucket, using either the xref:6.5@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Web interface] 
or the xref:6.5@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli[command line].
You will also need to xref:6.5@server:fts:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc#create-an-index[create a Search Index] -- Query indexes are taken care of by the Sample Bucket.
